                    Explain in your own words the point of figure 2-3. (I'm going to skip saying "in your own words"
                    going forward, but I hope you get the point; I expect all answers to be in your own words).
                </dt>
                <dd>
                    A histogram would be different by selecting different starting point of bin,
                    even though they are same data, and they have same bin width
                </dd>
            </dl>
            <dl>
                <dt>
                    The author of DAOST (Philipp Janert) likes KDEs (and think they're better than histograms).
                    And I don't. I didn't give a detailed explanation in the video, but now that works to my advantage.
                    I'll ask you guys to think about this and thereby create an excellent exercise:
                    When can KDEs be misleading?
                </dt>
                <dd>
                    There would be an inappropriate result with data which are not following a normal distribution,
                    when bandwidth becomes smaller.
                </dd>
            </dl>
            <dl>
                <dt>
                    I've discussed some strengths of the CDF - there are also weaknesses.
                    Janert writes "[CDFs] have less intuitive appeal than histograms of KDEs".
                    What does he mean by that?
                </dt>
                <dd>It is difficult to know what each data means in CDF, because it expresses data cumulative.</dd>
            </dl>
            <dl>
                <dt>What is a Quantile plot? What is it good for.</dt>
                <dd>
                    A quantile plot is a probability plot, which is a graphical method for comparing two
                    probability distributions by plotting there quantiles.
                    It is good for comparing shapes and tendencies with two data.
                </dd>
            </dl>
            <dl>
                <dt>How is a Probablity plot defined? What is it useful for? Have you ever seen one before?</dt>
                <dd>
                    The probability plot is a graphical technique for assessing whether or not a data set follows
                    a given distribution such as the normal or weibull.
                    It is useful for searching which distribution is likely to fit with the data.
                </dd>
            </dl>
            <dl>
                <dt>
                    One of the reasons I like DAOST is that Janert is so suspicious of mean, median,
                    and related summary statistics. Explain why one has to be careful when using those -
                    and why visualization of the full data is always better.
                </dt>
                <dd>
                    If there are outliers, some traditional features such as mean and median cannot represent the entire data.
                    It means that there would be some probability for data to be polluted.
                </dd>
            </dl>
            <dl>
                <dt>I love box plots. When are box plots most useful?</dt>
                <dd>It is very useful to handle with large amount of data and show the summary of data.</dd>
            </dl>
            <dl>
                <dt>
                    The book doesn't mention
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violin_plot" target="_blank">violin plots</a>.
                    Are those better or worse than box plots? Why?
                </dt>
                <dd>
                    Violin plots are better in the point of being able to represent more information,
                    but they cannot be visualized well if there is a few data and show the number of observation.

                    Looking at Fig 3-1, Janert writes "the data itself shows clearly that the amount of random noise
                    in the data is small". What do you think his argument is?
                </dt>
                <dd>
                    It means that the amount of random noise would be just few by using whole data,
                    without any statistical analysis.

                <dd>Residuals are the remainder when I subtract the smooth “trend” from the actual data.
                    It is a good idea because it is shown what a tendency gets change along the residual line.

                    Some changes in graph helps us to see patterns how it change. However,
                    it is hard to interpret if the graph it too skewed.

                    It is differentiated with graphical analysis and presentation graphics. Graphical analysis is
                    for getting new information by making a graph with unknown data. However,
                    presentation graphics is for communicating better each other by making graphics with already known data.
